    "Ans:Abstraction and Encapsulation are two important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). While both are related to data hiding and simplifying the implementation of complex systems, there are some differences between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details while showing only the essential features of the object to the outside world. Abstraction deals with the complexity of a system by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. In other words, it focuses on \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it. It is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the process of hiding implementation details and restricting access to data and methods within a class. Encapsulation ensures that data is protected from unauthorized access and modification, and it prevents data from being accessed directly by other objects. It is achieved by defining private variables and using getters and setters to access and modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to differentiate between the two concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a class called BankAccount, which represents a bank account. The BankAccount class has three attributes: account number, balance, and account holder name. We want to implement abstraction and encapsulation to hide the implementation details and protect the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can achieve abstraction by creating an abstract class called Account, which defines the essential features of a bank account. The Account class has abstract methods like deposit(), withdraw(), and getBalance(), which are implemented by the BankAccount class. Other classes, like SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount, can also extend the Account class and implement their own deposit(), withdraw(), and getBalance() methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve encapsulation, we can make the attributes of the BankAccount class private, which means they can only be accessed within the BankAccount class. We can provide public getters and setters to access and modify the attributes of the BankAccount class. For example, we can define the methods getAccountNumber(), getBalance(), and getAccountHolderName() to get the values of the account number, balance, and account holder name, respectively. We can also define the methods setBalance() and setAccountHolderName() to modify the balance and account holder name, respectively.\n"
